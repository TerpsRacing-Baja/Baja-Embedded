# Baja-Embedded

This repository contains all of the code used for Terps Racing Baja Crew embedded systems.
It is maintained by the Electronics and Testing subteam.

Currently, the repo contains in-development code for the car's on-board computer and data
collection system. The client code "blast" is designed to interface with a webserver
configured to display a live feed of car diagnostics.
